It is a deep learning trained predictor to identify promoters from non-promoters and further their strength. 
Feature Fusion technique have been used to identify promoters and their strength.
To identify promoters, CNN + BiLSTM models have been used.
To identify their strength, CNN + LSTM models have been used.
